ðŸ’« About Me:

Hi there! Iâ€™m Poulomi, an undergraduate student at MCKVIE, class of 2025. Coding has been my passion since high school, and Iâ€™ve enjoyed exploring it ever since. As a programmer and front-end web developer, I love crafting engaging and efficient web experiences. Additionally, I have a keen interest in machine learning and its wide-ranging applications.

Beyond coding, I serve as the Co-Lead of the Events Team at The Startup Club by MCKVIE. In this role, I help organize events that foster innovation and entrepreneurship among students.

When I'm not coding or planning events, you can find me watching anime.

Thanks for taking the time to learn a bit about me.

âœ¨ Currently:

Pre-final Year undergraduate at MCKV Institute of Engineering pursuing Bachelors in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
Lookking for internship opportunities in the fields of data analysis and front-end development.
